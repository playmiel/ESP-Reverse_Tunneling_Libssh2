# Reverse Tunneling Library for ESP32 using libssh2

This library provides reverse SSH tunneling capabilities for the ESP32 microcontroller, leveraging the libssh2 library. It enables the ESP32 to establish secure reverse tunnels to remote SSH servers, allowing external access to services running on the device behind NAT or firewalls.

## Features

- Reverse SSH tunneling from ESP32 to remote servers
- Built on top of the libssh2 library
- Secure and encrypted connections
- Lightweight and suitable for embedded environments

## Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- libssh2 library ported for ESP32
- Compatible toolchain (e.g., ESP-IDF)

## Usage

1. Integrate the library into your ESP32 project.
2. Configure SSH server credentials and tunnel parameters.
3. Initialize the library and start the reverse tunnel.
